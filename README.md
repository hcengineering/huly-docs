# Huly Docs

[Huly Docs](https://docs.huly.io/) contains documentation for the Huly platform. While Huly Docs is currently in the early stages of development, our goal is for all concepts and features to be fully documented for our users.

## Local development

To verify and preview documentation locally:

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The documentation will be available at `http://localhost:4321` (or the next available port).

3. **Build and preview the production build:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```
   This will run type checking (`astro check`) and build the documentation, then serve a preview of the production build.

## Submitting requests and feedback

If there is a specific concept or feature you'd like to see covered in Huly Docs, the best way to let us know is to join our [Huly Community](https://huly.link/slack) on Slack to connect with other Huly users and communicate directly with our team.

Requests and feedback may also be submitted by email to [hey@huly.io](hey@huly.io).

Your valuable input will guide which features we prioritize and help us create more thorough documentation for users!
