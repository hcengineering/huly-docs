Huly's Telegram integration provides the following functionality:

1. Receive and respond to Huly notifications from Telegram, including internal chat messages and workspace activity.
2. Communicate with any external Telegram user directly from Huly, even if they are not a Huly user themselves.

Telegram provides a way for Huly users to stay connected with their workspace while on the go, ensuring that they never miss important updates or messages. It also provides a means for managing external conversations within the Huly workspace, right alongside internal communications.

### Connecting with Telegram

To connect your Telegram account to Huly, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to Settings and select Integrations from the left sidebar menu. In the Telegram integration card, click `Add`.
2. Enter your phone number and click `Next`.
3. Enter the 5-digit code you receive on your Telegram account and click `Connect`.

### Telegram notifications settings

After connecting with Telegram, you can customize your notifications settings. Navigate to Notifications in the left sidebar menu and ensure Telegram notifications are enabled under "General". 

From the notifications setting menu, you can select which kinds of Huly notifications you'd like to receive in Telegram. 

For example, you could toggle notifications for Chat, allowing you to receive internal Huly messages in your Telegram account. You can also toggle notifications for Issues, Applications, GitHub and more.

### Responding to Huly activity in Telegram

After enabling Telegram notifications, you will begin to receive messages from Huly in your Telegram account.

To respond to a message, right-click or reply directly to the message thread in Telegram. Your response will be sent back to Huly and displayed in the appropriate chat or activity thread.

> **Note:** Simply replying in the Telegram chat will not send your message to Huly. You must reply directly to the Huly message thread.

### Communicating with external contacts

Huly's Telegram client allows you to add a Telegram account for any contact and communicate with them directly from Huly. This is useful for managing external conversations within the Huly workspace.

To connect with an external contact from Huly, follow these steps:

1. Open the contact page for the person you'd like to connect with through Telegram. Click `Add social links` and select `Telegram`.
2. Enter the contact's Telegram username or phone number and click the blue check icon.
3. Click the Telegram icon and then the arrow to open a new Telegram conversation with the contact. From here, you can send messages directly to the contact from Huly.

After initiating contact through Telegram from Huly, any replies from that user will appear in both Telegram and Huly, and you can continue the conversation from either platform. You'll find your synced correspondence both in the contact's page and in your Huly Inbox.

##### Sharing Telegram conversations with your team

In some cases, you may wish to share a conversation you have with a Telegram contact with other members of your workspace. With Huly's Telegram integration, you can easily publish select messages to a contact's activity record, making them visible to your team.

There are several examples of the kinds of messages you might want to save to a contact's activity record:

* Communication from a client about specific project details
* Feedback received on a design or proposal
* Answers to questions about a project or task
* Scheduling or availability details for a job application candidate
* Follow up conversations with a sales lead

These are just some examples, but this feature can be used in any way you need depending on your own unique workflows.

To save a message to a contact's activity record, follow these steps:

1. Open the conversation between you and your contact in Huly, either from the contact's page or from your Huly Inbox.
2. Click the share icon in the top right corner of the conversation.
3. Select any messages you'd like to share and click `Publish selected`.
