Huly's Telegram integration provides the following functionality:

1. Receive and respond to Huly notifications from Telegram, including internal chat messages and workspace activity.
2. Communicate with any external Telegram user directly from Huly, even if they are not a Huly user themselves (coming soon).

Telegram provides a way for Huly users to stay connected with their workspace while on the go, ensuring that they never miss important updates or messages. In the near future, our Telegram client will also provide a means for managing external conversations within the Huly workspace, right alongside internal communications.

### Telegram notifications: connect to the bot

To connect with our Telegram bot, navigate to Settings > Notifications. Under "General", toggle on Telegram notifications. Then, click `Configure` to connect your Telegram account.

Open the link to `hulyio_bot` and follow the prompts on the screen to enter the code and click `Ok`.

From the notifications settings menu, you can also select which kinds of Huly notifications you'd like to receive in Telegram for different kinds of workspace activity.

For example, you could toggle notifications for Chat, allowing you to receive internal Huly messages in your Telegram account. You can also toggle notifications for Issues, Applications, GitHub and more.

##### Responding to Huly activity in Telegram

After enabling Telegram notifications, you will begin to receive messages from Huly in your Telegram account.

To respond to a message, right-click or reply directly to the message thread in Telegram. Your response will be sent back to Huly and displayed in the appropriate chat or activity thread.

> **Note:** Simply replying in the Telegram chat will not send your message to Huly. You must reply directly to the Huly message thread.

### Coming soon: Use Telegram to connect with external contacts

To enable Telegram integration, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to Settings and select Integrations from the left sidebar menu. In the Telegram integration card, click `Add`.
2. Enter your phone number and click `Next`.
3. Enter the 5-digit code you receive on your Telegram account and click `Connect`.

In the near future, Huly's Telegram client will allow you to add a Telegram account for any contact and communicate with them directly from Huly. This will be useful for managing external conversations within the Huly workspace.

In some cases, you may wish to share a conversation you have with a Telegram contact with other members of your workspace. In an upcoming version of Huly, you'll be able to easily publish selected messages to a contact's activity record, making them visible to your team.

Stay tuned for more updates to our Telegram integration in the near future!
