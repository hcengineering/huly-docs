Huly provides an optional integration with Gmail, allowing you to connect to a Gmail account to send and receive emails without ever leaving the platform. The current version of Gmail integration offers the following features:

* Send emails to contacts from Huly
* Receive and reply to emails from contacts in Huly

Currently, emails are accessible through the contact page, but a future version will include a centralized email inbox where you can manage emails from multiple accounts in one place. You'll also be able to easily convert email threads into shared notes, tasks and more. This guide covers the features included in the current version, but keep an eye out for more updates soon!

## Connect to Gmail

To connect with Gmail, navigate to Settings > Integrations. Under `Gmail`, click `Add` and select the Gmail account you want to connect. Follow the prompts to authorize Huly to access your Gmail account.

## Sending emails

Navigate to the contact page of the recipient and find the mail icon below their name. If you haven't entered an email for the contact yet, you can do this by clicking `Add social links`. Hover over the mail icon, then click the arrow icon to open the email window. 

If you've just connected to Gmail for the first time, you may see the window begin to populate with your email history with that contact, as the Gmail integration imports your past emails. This process should only take a few seconds, but may take longer depending on the number of emails that are imported.

To send a new email, click `Create message`. Enter a subject, optional CC email address, and message. Note that you can also add attachments if needed. Then, click `Send`.

## Receiving and replying to emails

When you've received an email from a contact, it will appear in the same email window that you opened for sending emails. We are working on improving the notifications for emails and will soon move emails to a centralized inbox, but for now you'll be able to find them only through the contact page.

To reply to an email, click the `Reply` button in the top right corner. You can edit the subject and message as needed, and then click `Send` to send your reply.
