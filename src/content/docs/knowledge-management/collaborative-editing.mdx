One of the most powerful features of Huly documents is the ability for team members to collaborate in real time. Users can see each others' cursors and edits as they happen, making it easy to work together on planning materials, meeting notes, and other share project resources.

When collaborating on a document, click on any member's icon to jump to their live cursor on the page:

<div style="position: relative; padding-top: 56.25%;">
  <iframe
    src="https://customer-davn16od7sue0s1k.cloudflarestream.com/da42cfc74a52ab06d15af987dd55941e/iframe?poster=https%3A%2F%2Fcustomer-davn16od7sue0s1k.cloudflarestream.com%2Fda42cfc74a52ab06d15af987dd55941e%2Fthumbnails%2Fthumbnail.jpg%3Ftime%3D%26height%3D600"
    loading="lazy"
    style="border: none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; width: 100%;"
    allow="accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;"
    allowfullscreen="true"
  ></iframe>
</div>

### Editing during a meeting
Video calls in Huly can be easily pinned to the right side of the window, allowing team members to continue to view the call while navigating the platform. This makes it easy to reference documents, take notes, and make changes to documents during a meeting.

### Assigning action items
When working on projects together, it may be helpful to assign small action items that aren't necessarily connected to any particular issue in the Tracker. Check out our guide on [assigning action items in documents](/knowledge-management/documents-action-items) to learn more about this feature!
