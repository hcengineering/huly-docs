There are many uses for documents on the Huly platform, including sharing reference materials among team members, collaborating on plans and roadmaps, saving meeting notes and assigning action items. This guide will walk you through the basics of creating and formatting documents, as well as some of the options available for managing your documents. For more advanced document features, see the following guides:

- [Collaborative editing](/knowledge-management/collaborative-editing)
- [Action items in documents](/knowledge-management/documents-action-items)

### Creating a teamspace

Documents are organized into teamspaces, which can be used to model your team's specific needs. For example, you may choose to organize your documents into teamspaces called "Features", "Marketing", "Style Guides" etc.

To create a teamspace, click the `+` that appears when hovering over the word "Teamspaces" in the sidebar, or by clicking the dropdown arrow next to the `+ Create a document` button and selecting `Create teamspace`.

From here, you can enter the following details:

- **Space type** - Currently defaults to settings optimal for the Huly platform
- **Teamspace title** - A title for your teamspace
- **Description** - A description of your teamspace
- **Icon** - Choose an icon to represent your teamspace, either from a default icon with a custom color, or an emoji
- **Owner** - Select the owner of the teamspace
- **Make private** - Toggles whether the teamspace is visible to people outside of the selected members
- **Members** - Select which members are a part of this teamspace
- **Auto join** - Toggles whether new workspace members will be automatically added as members of this teamspace

Click `Create`.

### Creating a document

There are two ways to create a document:

- Click the `+ Create a document` button at the top of the documents sidebar. This opens a dialog with the option to select a teamspace for your document; the default parent will be the most recently selected teamspace or document. Enter a title for your document and click `Create`.
- Hover over a teamspace name or any other document and click the `+` button that appears. The new document will automatically be nested within the teamspace or document you selected.

### Formatting document content

Documents support markdown formatting. There are a few ways to access formatting options for your text:

- Type markdown syntax directly into your document.
- Use the floating toolbar that appears when text is selected on the page.

Formatting options include headers, text emphasis, links, blockquotes, numbered and bulleted lists, and code blocks.

Images, tables and separator lines are also available by hovering over text and clicking the `+` icon that appears on the left side.

### @mentions

Mention a team member by using @mention syntax. The member will receive a notification that they have been mentioned in the document.

Use `@` to tag any issue or document in Huly. Soon, all objects in Huly will be available to tag anywhere, including Drive files, teamspaces and more - keep an eye out for updates on this feature!

### Adding notes

To add a note to a document, highlight the text you would like to add the note for and click the `Note` icon in the floating toolbar. Enter the content of your note and choose a color, then click `Set`. Notes will appear as a small icon next to the text you've added them to, and can be viewed by anyone with access to the document.

To edit or delete a note, simply highlight the same text and click the note icon to open the dialog. From there, you can update the content and color of the note, or click `Remove` to delete it.

### Assigning action items

When working on projects together, it may be helpful to assign small action items that aren't necessarily connected to any particular issue in the Tracker. Check out our guide on [assigning action items in documents](/knowledge-management/documents-action-items) to learn more about this feature!

### Working with tables

A table can be insterted into a document (or anywhere tables are supported) by typing `/` and selecting `Table`. This will open a dialog where you can specify the number of rows and columns for your table.

To view options for table formatting, click on the 'Customize table' icon in the floating toolbar at the top right corner of the table. Here, you'll find options to add and delete rows and columns, merge and split cells, and delete the entire table.

Also in the floating toolbar is the 'Set cell color' icon. Here, you can set a background color for specific table cells. The colors dynamically adapt to dark and light mode interfaces.

You can also resize columns by clicking and dragging the lines between them.

### Options for documents

A number of additional options for documents are available using the toolbar at the top right of the document:

- **Settings** - Opens a dialog with options to create a new document, copy the URL, lock, move or print the document, generate a public link, or delete the document.
- **Clipboard** - Copies the document link.
- **Width** - Set narrow or wide view for the document.
- **Backlinks** - Displays everywhere the document has been linked to (see below).
- **Activity** - Displays all activity related to the document, including changes, embeds, and mentions.

### Viewing backlinks

To view everywhere a document has been mentioned, click the paper clip icon in the top right corner. This will open a side panel showing everywhere an @mention has been used to link to that document.
