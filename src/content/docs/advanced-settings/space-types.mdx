## What are space types?

Space types are the highest level of customization in Huly. They define the structure of your workspace by applying a shared set of roles and task types to all spaces created with that type.

The tracker in Huly is based on the `Classic project` space type. This space type comes with no preset roles, and one task type (`Issue`) with process states of `Backlog`, `Todo`, `In Progress`, `Done` and `Canceled`. By default, new projects created in the tracker will use this space type.

However, you may wish to create your own space types to model different types of processes that you'll be tracking in your workspace. For example, you could create space types for "Client projects", "Internal projects" and "Bug tracking", each of which could have its own [roles](/advanced-settings/roles) and [task types](/advanced-settings/task-types).

## Customizing default space types

You can find all of the settings for your space types under `Settings` in the left sidebar menu. Click on `SPACE TYPES` to see a list of all space types available in your workspace. Click on any space type to view and edit its settings.

Some properties and attributes for spaces are not currently customizable. Settings in the first block cannot be changed, but you can customize each space type's [roles](/advanced-settings/roles) and task types [here](/advanced-settings/task-types).

## Creating custom space types

To create a new space type, click the `+` button next to `SPACE TYPES` in the left sidebar menu of your settings.

In the top left corner, select what kind of space you'd like to create a space type for. If you choose `Tracker`, you'll also have the option to base your space type on the `Classic project`.

Once your custom space type has been created, you can add [roles](/advanced-settings/roles) and task types [here](/advanced-settings/task-types).

## Using your custom space type

Custom space types cannot be used for existing projects. To use your custom space type, you'll need to create a new project and select your custom space type from the `Space type` dropdown menu.

If you've added roles, you'll be able to add members to each role when you create your project.
