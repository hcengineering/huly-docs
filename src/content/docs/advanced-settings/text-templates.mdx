## What are text templates?

Text templates can help you save time and maintain consistency across your workspace. With text templates, you can create predefined text structures that can be used for task descriptions, chats, comments and more.

Text templates allow you to define reusable content structures that can be used across various features in your workspace. These templates can help ensure consistency, reduce repetitive typing, and improve collaboration by providing clear, standardized formats.

> **Note:** The `Field` option is still in development, so it is recommended to instead create your own "blanks" in your template to fill in when you use them.

## Creating and managing text templates

To create and manage text templates, navigate to Settings and select `Text Templates` from the `WORKSPACE SETTINGS` area in the left sidebar menu. Here, you can create new templates or edit existing ones.

To create a new text template, click the `Create template` button. Enter a title for the template, define the structure, formatting and placeholders, and save the template to a folder.

By default, new templates are saved to the `Public templates` folder, where they can be accessed by anyone in the workspace. To make your templates private, create a new template group and toggle the privacy setting.

## Using text templates

Once created, text templates can be accessed from chat messages, comments, issue descriptions, and anywhere else the text template icon is available. Simply click the text template icon and select the template you'd like to use.

There are many areas of your workspace where text templates are useful. Here are a few examples of use cases:

- **Recurring task descriptions:** Define specific formatting for recurring tasks, or just create basic reusable styling for your content.

- **Quick chat replies**: Use predefined responses for common questions or updates.

- **Meeting invites**: Standardize recurring meeting announcements:

**_Example:_**
```
    Reminder: Our [Meeting Name] is scheduled for [Date and Time].
    Please review the agenda here: [Link].
```
- **Code Reviews**: Use templates to standardize feedback on code:

**_Example:_**
```
    Code: [File/Line reference]
    Observation: [Issue/Feedback]
    Suggested change: [Proposed solution]
```
