Roles determine the kinds of permissions users have in Huly. Roles can be set both at the workspace level and at the "space" level (see [Space types](/advanced-settings/space-types)).

### Owners and maintainers

Navigate to Settings and select `Owners` from the `WORKSPACE SETTINGS` menu.

From here, you can select a role for each team member:

- **Owner** - The workspace owner has full control over the workspace. They can remove team members, create and delete spaces, and manage workspace settings. A workspace can have multiple owners.
- **Maintainer** - Maintainers have the same permissions as owners, except they cannot delete the workspace, remove the owner, or remove team members. Maintainers can create custom space types and task types, but can't delete spaces they aren't an owner of.
- **User** - Users can create and manage spaces, but they cannot manage workspace settings or emove team members. Users cannot create custom space types or task types, and they cannot delete spaces that they aren't an owner of.

> **Note:** In order to enable workspace ownership for a second user, that user must also be added to the `Admin` role (see below).

### Admins

You can also set admins for all spaces within the workspace. Admins have full permissions when it comes to spaces themselves, such as archiving and deleting projects, but they cannot delete the workspace, remove the workspace owner, or access any of the workspace settings.

### Space-level roles

Roles can also be set at the space level. In Settings under the `SPACE TYPES` menu, navigate to the space you'd like to manage and find the `Roles` section.

Default space types do not include roles, but you can create them by clicking the `+` button. Enter a name for your role and click `Create`. Then, click on your role to select specific permissions. Currently, permissions available are "Update space", "Archive space" and "Forbid delete object".

Once your roles have been created, you'll be able to assign roles to team members for spaces using that space type.
