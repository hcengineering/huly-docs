Huly offers a high degree of configurability through Classes. A class is a set or category of things having some property in common. In other words, classes are a way to group objects together based on shared properties.

To access class settings, navigate to settings and click `Classes` in the `WORKSPACE SETTINGS` menu. You'll see a list of all the classes in your workspace. Clicking on any class will display its properties.

### Customizing class properties

Currently, only the `Contact` and `Task` classes can be customized.

To add a property, click the `+` button. Choose from the following property types:

- URL
- String - for single-line text
- Boolean - select Yes, No, or N/A
- Number
- Date
- Ref - (not yet implemented)
- Array - (not yet implemented)
- Enum - select from a list of options (see below)

You'll see that your new property will now appear on any object belonging to that class.

To remove a property, open the settings menu to the left of the property and click `Remove`. You can also hide a property here as well by clicking `Hide attribute`.

### Enums

Enums are a type of property that allows you to select from a list of options. For example, you could add a property called "How we met" to your contacts and use options like "Conference", "Mutual friend", "Cold call" etc.

To create an enum, navigate to Settings > Enums and click the `+ Create enum` button. Add options and click `Save`.

You can also create enums directly from the Classes settings. After creating a new property with the type `enum`, use the `+` button to create a new enum for that class.

### Example use-case
