  <h5><strong>What is a Card?</strong></h5>
  <p>A Card is an instance of a Type, representing a specific piece of structured information. It follows the properties defined by its Type and can include rich text, attachments, relations, and tags, making it a flexible building block for knowledge management.</p>

To use Cards effectively in Huly, it’s important to first understand their relationship with Types.

Think of a **Type** as a blueprint and **Cards** as the structures built from that blueprint. If your blueprint defines a "house" as a structure with four windows and one door, then every house created from that blueprint will always have four windows and one door, regardless of color or furnishings.

If you haven't already, check out our guide on [Creating Types](/cards/types/creating-types) — then return here to learn how to create Cards from the Types you've made.

## Creating Cards

Click `+ Create Card` in the top left corner of the Cards module.

The following elements make up a Card:

1. **Title** - a name for your Card
2. **Type** - the Type that defines the properties of your Card (see [Creating Types](/cards/types/creating-types))
4. **Properties** - the details of your Card, as defined by the Type
5. **Rich text editor** - a collaborative text editing area that supports markdown formatting, images, tables and more
6. **Children** - an area for adding child Cards (see [Parent-child Cards](/cards/creating-cards/#parent-child-cards))
7. **Attachments** - an area for uploading files
8. **Activity** - a log of all changes made to the Card and area for commenting

> **Note:** Cards created from the `File` Type will have an additional area above the rich text editor for uploading files. To learn more about managing files with the `File` Type, see [File Types](/cards/types/file-types).

Beyond the basic elements, Cards can also include:

* **[Relations](/cards/relations/relations-overview)** - connections to other Cards
* **[Tags](/cards/tags/tags-overview)** - optional properties that can be applied to Cards of different types

### Example: Creating a Character Card

Let’s walk through an example using our **game design** system.

!! INSERT IMAGE: Hero Card

This is a Card created from the `Character` Type, which is derived from `Game Component`. For more on how Types are derived, see [Creating a derived Type](/cards/types/create-a-type/#creating-derived-types).

This Card also has `Movement` and `Health` [Tags](/cards/tags/tags-overview), which provide additional properties.

The `Character` Card also has several [Relations](/cards/relations/relations-overview), defined on its Type:
* **`Item`** - a `Character` possesses `Items`
* **`Environment`** - a `Character` exists in an `Environment`
* **`Image Asset`** - a `Character` is depicted by an `Image Asset`

## Parent-child Cards

A parent-child relationship structures Cards hierarchically:

* A parent Card can have multiple child Cards.
* A child Card can only belong to onw parent.

It's best to use parent-child Cards when the child Cards are best understood in the context of their parent.

In our **game design** example, we may want to create a parent `Environment` Card representing a fictional region that contains child `Environment` Cards representing fictional locations within that region.

To further explore working with Cards, check out these guides:

 * [Relating Cards](/cards/relations/relating-cards) - Define structured relationships between Cards.
* [File Types](/cards/types/file-types) - Manage images, videos, PDFs, and other media within Huly's default `File` Type.
* [Tags](/cards/tags/tags-overview) - Apply additional attributes across different Types.

By understanding and structuring Cards effectively, you can build a powerful and flexible knowledge management system in Huly.
