## ðŸ“š Dive into real-world use cases

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for designing your own Cards system

While it's helpful to look at example use cases when considering how to use Cards in your own workspace, you are ultimately the architect of your own knowledge management system, and it's up to you how to prefer to structure your information. Here are some tips to help you design your own Cards system:

1. **Start simple:** Begin with a few core Types that cover your most important information. You can always expand later as your needs grow. It's also possible to change the Type of a Card after it's been created â€” so no worries if you decide to re-organize later!

2. **Keep processes in mind:** If you read the [Introduction to Cards](/cards/cards-overview) doc, you already know that we are currently building a new process management system entirely based on Cards. You'll be able to build processes like customized leads funnels, agile workflows, customer management systems and more â€” all from a foundation built with Cards. If you think you'd like to leverage Cards for your processes in the future, we suggest building your information architecture with this in mind.

3. **Connect Cards to the rest of your workspace:** While we expect to deliver processes by the end of Q2 2025, you can already connect Cards to other parts of your workspace. From any Card, you can create a Reference attribute to point to any person or company already in your Contacts. You can also link to Cards from anywhere â€” including chats and issue descriptions â€” using @ mention syntax. Try it out!

4. **Reach out for support and inspiration!** Join over 2,700 members in our [Slack community](https://huly.link/slack) to ask questions, share your use cases, and provide feedback and feature requests for our team. We're happy to help you get started with Cards and would love to work with you to make this system as useful as possible.
