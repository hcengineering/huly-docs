  <h5><strong>What is a Card?</strong></h5>
  <p>A Card is an instance of a Type, representing a specific piece of structured information. It follows the properties defined by its Type and can include rich text, attachments, relations, and tags, making it a flexible building block.</p>

To use Cards effectively in Huly, it’s important to first understand their relationship with Types. 

Think of a **Type** as a blueprint and **Cards** as the structures built from that blueprint. If your blueprint defines a "house" as a structure with four windows and one door, then every house created from that blueprint will always have four windows and one door, regardless of color or furnishings.

If you haven't already, check out our guide on [Creating Types](/cards/types/creating-types) — then return here to learn how to create Cards from the Types you've made.

## Creating Cards

Click `+ Create Card` in the top left corner of the Cards module.

The following elements make up a Card:

1. **Title** - a name for your Card
2. **Type** - the Type that defines the properties of your Card (see [Creating Types](/cards/types/creating-types))
4. **Properties** - the details of your Card, as defined by the Type
5. **Rich text editor** - a collaborative text editing area that supports markdown formatting, images, tables and more
6. **Children** - an area for adding child Cards (see [Parent-child Cards](/cards/creating-cards/#parent-child-cards))
7. **Attachments** - an area for uploading files
8. **Activity** - a log of all changes made to the Card and area for commenting

> **Note:** Cards created from the `File` Type will have an additional area above the rich text editor for uploading files. To learn more about managing files with the `File` Type, see [File Types](/cards/types/file-types).

Beyond these basic elements, Cards can also include:

* **[Relations](/cards/relations/relations-overview)** - connections to other Cards
* **[Tags](/cards/tags/tags-overview)** - optional properties that can be applied to Cards of different types

Relations and Tags are set at the Type level. In other words, when you want to create a new Relation or Tag for a Card, you'll need to define this on the Type in Settings. To see how, check out these guides on [Defining Relations](/cards/types/defining-relations) and [Creating Tags](/cards/tags/creating-tags).

### Example: Creating an NPC Character Card

To create a Card, first make sure you've selected the correct Type from the left side menu, then click the `+ Create Card` button. 

From here, you can enter information in all of the attributes you [defined on your Type](/cards/types/creating-types). Below is an example of a Card for an NPC character in our **game design system**:

<Image src={cardExampleNPC} alt="Example of an NPC Card" inferSize quality="max" />

Note that this `NPC` Card has several [Relations](/cards/relations/relations-overview), defined on the `Character` Type from which it was derived:
* **`Item`** - a `Character` possesses `Items`
* **`Environment`** - a `Character` exists in an `Environment`
* **`Game Narrative`** - a `Character` is included in a `Game Narrative`

## Adding Card attribbutes

To add an attribute to a Card, simply click the `+` icon next to the Type or Tag you want to add to. Adding a attribute on one Card will add the field to all existing Cards with that Type or Tag.

To further explore working with Cards, check out these guides:

 * [Relating Cards](/cards/relations/relating-cards) - Define structured relationships between Cards.
* [File Types](/cards/types/file-types) - Manage images, videos, PDFs, and other media within Huly's default `File` Type.
* [Tags](/cards/tags/tags-overview) - Apply additional attributes across different Types.

By understanding and structuring Cards effectively, you can build a powerful and flexible knowledge management system in Huly.
