While both Relations and parent-child connections allow you to link Cards, they serve different purposes and are used in distinct scenarios.

Here are some general guidelines:

* Use **parent-child** relationships when one entity (the "child") is dependent on another entity (the "parent") and logically belongs under it. You can learn more about this in our guide on [Parent-child Cards](/cards/creating-cards/#parent-child-cards).

* Use **Relations** when both entities exist independently but need to be linked to reflect their interaction or connection. Relations don't imply a hierarchical structure, just that the entities are related in some way.
