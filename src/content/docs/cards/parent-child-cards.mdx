Cards can be connected through a parent-child relationship, where the child Card is best understood in the context of its parent Card. This is useful for creating a hierarchical structure of knowledge and information.

## Creating a child Card

To create a new child Card, click the `+ Create child` button on the parent Card. A new blank Card will be opened, where you can enter any information you want. The child Card will automatically be linked to the parent Card.

## Connecting existing Cards as parent-child

To connect an existing Card to a parent, right-click on the Card in the list or table view, or open the settings menu on the Card's page. Select `Set parent` from the list, then select a Card for the parent.

## Disconnecting parent-child Cards

Any child Card can be disconnected from its parent by right-clicking or opening the settings menu and selecting `Unset parent`.

## Parent-child vs. Relations

While both Relations and parent-child connections allow you to link Cards, they serve different purposes and are used in distinct scenarios.

Here are some general guidelines:

* Use **parent-child** relationships when one entity (the "child") is dependent on another entity (the "parent") and logically belongs under it, or when a hierarchical structure is needed.

* Use **[Relations](/cards/relations/relations-overview)** when both entities exist independently but need to be linked to reflect their interaction or connection. Relations don't imply a hierarchical structure, just that the entities are related in some way.
