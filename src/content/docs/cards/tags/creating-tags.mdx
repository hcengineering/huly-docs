In the previous guide, we learned about Tags and how they can be used to define behaviors or attributes that extend a Cardâ€™s functionality. Now, let's put that knowledge into practice and create some Tags.

## Creating a Tag

Navigate to Settings and select the Type you want to add Tags to; then, click the `+` button in the Tags area. Add a name for your Tag and click `Create`.

Here, we've created three new Tags for our `NPC` Type:

<Image src={tags} alt="Tags" inferSize quality="max" />

## Adding Tag properties

Click on any Tag to open it. To add a property to a Tag, click the `+` button in the properties section. Adding properties to a Tag is the same as adding properties to a Type (see [this guide](/cards/types/creating-types/#adding-properties)). These properties will only be available on Cards using that Tag.

In our **game design** example, we've added some custom properties that exist on the `Merchant` Tag. We can see that the `Merchant` Tag has also inherited properties from `NPC`, `Character` and `Game Component` Types:

<Image src={tagProperties} alt="Tag properties" inferSize quality="max" />
