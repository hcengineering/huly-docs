In the previous guide, we learned about Tags and how they can be used to define behaviors or attributes that extend a Cardâ€™s functionality. Now, let's put that knowledge into practice and create some Tags.

## Creating a Tag

Navigate to Settings and select the Type you want to add Tags to; then, click the `+` button in the Tags area. Add a name for your Tag and click `Create`.

You'll notice that the Tag has inherited properties from its Type, which are listed in the top section. In our **game design** example, we've can see that the `Movement` Tag has inherited the "Role" property from the `Character` Type, as well as the "Name" and "Description" properties from the `Game Component` Type.

## Adding Tag properties

To add a property to a Tag, click the `+` button in the properties section. Adding properties to a Tag is the same as adding properties to a Type (see [this guide](/cards/types/creating-types/#adding-properties)). These properties will only be available on Cards using that Tag.

In our **game design** example, we've added properties for "Speed", "Acceleration", "Jump height" and "Mode" to the `Movement` Tag. We can apply this Tag to any `Character` Type that requires movement capabilities, such as players and enemies.

We'll also create a `Health` Tag with its own set of unique properties.
