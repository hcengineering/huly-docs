In the previous guide, we learned about Tags and how they can be used to define behaviors or attributes that extend a Cardâ€™s functionality. Now, let's put that knowledge into practice and create some Tags.

## Creating a Tag

Navigate to Settings and select the Type you want to add Tags to; then, click the `+` button in the Tags area. Add a name for your Tag and click `Create`.

## Adding Tag properties

Click on any Tag to open it. To add a property to a Tag, click the `+` button in the properties section. Adding properties to a Tag is the same as adding properties to a Type (see [this guide](/cards/types/creating-types/#adding-properties)). These properties will only be available on Cards using that Tag.

In our **game design** example, we've added a custom property "Flying speed" that exists on the `Flying` Tag:

<Image src={tagPropertiesFlying} alt="Tag properties" inferSize quality="max" />

To the `Wizard` Tag, we've added a property "mana":

<Image src={tagPropertiesWizard} alt="Tag properties" inferSize quality="max" />
