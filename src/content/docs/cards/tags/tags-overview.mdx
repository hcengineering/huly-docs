  <h5><strong>What is a Tag?</strong></h5>
  <p>A Tag is a set of additional properties that can be applied to a Card, allowing you to define behaviors or attributes that extend a Card’s functionality. Tags provide flexibility by enabling shared properties across different Types without requiring new Types.</p>
</div>

We've seen how we can [create variations of a Type](/cards/types/creating-types/#creating-derived-types). But what if we want to define some kind of behavior or functionality without altering the core structure of the Type itself? 

For example, in our game design system, consider the `NPC` Type, which is derived from `Character`. An NPC has several of its own attributes, affiliation and respawn. However, an NPC could be also have a role, such as a merhcant, guild member or rogue, and each of these roles has unique attributes. In this case, we can create **Tags** to define these sets of attributes:

- **`Merchant`** Tag
  - Buy/Sell stolen items? (yes/no)
  - Inventory (Ref Items)
- **`Guild Member`** Tag
  - Guild role (text)
- **`Rogue`** Tag
  - Weapons (Ref Items)

In our next guide, we'll learn how to create the Tags we just described and apply them to our `NPC` Type. Check out [Creating Tags](/cards/tags/creating-tags) to get started!

## Tags vs. Types
> *__But wait__, couldn't I just create separate Types for Merchants, Guild Members and Rogues?*

**Yes, you absolutely can!** Creating separate Types for each variation is a valid approach. However, the benefit of using Tags is flexibility — you don’t need to create a new Type for every possible combination of behaviors or attributes. Instead, Tags allow you to mix and match properties based on the unique needs of each Card. On the other hand, creating new Types might be more appropriate if the differences between variations are fundamental to the design or behavior of the Card.

Both methods have their pros and cons. It’s up to you, as the system designer, to experiment and choose the approach that best suits your needs.
