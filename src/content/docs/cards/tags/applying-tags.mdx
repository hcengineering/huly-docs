Now that we've learned about [Tags](/cards/tags/tags-overview) and how to [create](/cards/tags/creating-tags) them, let's explore how to apply them to our Cards. First, you'll need to create a Card from a Type that has Tags. If you haven't already, check out our guides on [creating Cards](/cards/creating-cards).

## Adding a Tag to a Card

To add a Tag to a Card, click the `+` icon beside the Type. You'll be able to select from any Tags that have been created for that Type.

For our **game design** example, we're applying the `Movement` and `Health` Tags to our `Character` Card. These Tags provide additional properties that define how the character moves and manages health stats.

## Removing a Tag from a Card

To remove a Tag from a Card, simply click the `x` icon beside the Tag name. This will remove the Tag and all its associated properties from the Card.
