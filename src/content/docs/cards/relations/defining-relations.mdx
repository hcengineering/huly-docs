To define Relations between Types, navigate to Settings and open the Type you want to add a Relation to. Click the `+` button in the Relations area.

## Naming Relations

When defining a Relation, you'll need to give it a clear and descriptive name on both sides. The names should be human-readable and indicate the nature of the relationship between the two entities.

Let's look at some examples of Relations on our `Character` Type:

* **Possessed by** (`Character`) - **Possesses** (`Item`)
  * *Meaning: A Character **possesses** an Item; an Item is **possessed by** a Character.*
 
 
* **Inhabited by** (`Character`) - **Exists in** (`Environment`)
  * *Meaning: A Character **exists in** an Environment; an Environment is **inhabited by** a Character.*
 
   
* **Features** (`Character`) - **Included in** (`Game Narrative`)
  * *Meaning: A Character is **included in** a Game Narrative; a Game Narrative **features** a Character*

These names describe how two Types are connected, allowing the system to establish their relationships clearly and logically.

## Selecting the kind of Relation

When creating a Relation, you must specify the kind of relationship between the entities. There are three kinds to choose from:

#### 1:1 Relation
**Definition**: One entity of the first type is related to exactly one entity of the second type.

**Example**: An `Item` has only one `Audio Asset`, and an `Audio Asset` is only used by one Item.

**Use case**: This type of relation is ideal for cases where a single instance of one entity is paired with a single instance of another. For instance, each `Item` may have a unique `Audio Asset` associated with it.

#### 1:N Relation
**Definition**: One entity of the first type is related to multiple entities of the second type.

**Example**: A `Quest` can have multiple `Objectives`, but each `Objective` belongs to only one `Quest`.

**Use case**: This relation type is commonly used when a single entity (like a `Quest`) can be linked to multiple related entities (like `Objectives`), but each related entity (an `Objective`) is only connected to that one instance of the first entity.

#### N:N Relation

**Definition**: Multiple entities of the first type are related to multiple entities of the second type.

**Example**: A `Character` can have multiple `Items`, and an `Item` can be used by multiple `Characters`.

**Use case**: This relation type is useful when many instances of one entity (e.g., `Character`) can be associated with many instances of another entity (e.g., `Items`). It reflects a more dynamic, interconnected system, like a character inventory or shared assets.

By defining clear and meaningful Relations between your Types, you can create a system where entities are connected in ways that mirror their real-world interactions. This adds depth to your data structure, making it easier to navigate, manage, and scale as your system grows.
