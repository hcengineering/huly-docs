After setting up [Relations](/cards/relations/defining-relations), you can start relating Cards to each other.

Navigate to any Card created from a Type that has Relations. Near the bottom of the Card, you'll find all of the Relations you defined in Settings.

## Adding a Relation

Click the `+` button to add a Card. You'll see a dropdown menu of all available Cards of the related Type. Select a Card to establish the connection.

In our **game design** example, we've defined Relations between `Character`, `Item` and `Environment` Type. Here, we can see the name of each Relation and all of its related Cards.

## Removing a Relation

To remove a related Card, simply right-click on the Card name and select `Remove relation`. This will break the connection between the two Cards.

To delete the Relation entirely, navigate back to Settings, open the Relation and click the trash icon. This will break the relations for all associated Cards.

## Relations vs. Parent-child Cards

While both Relations and parent-child connections allow you to link Cards, they serve different purposes and are used in distinct scenarios.

Here are some general guidelines:

* Use **parent-child** relationships when one entity (the "child") is dependent on another entity (the "parent") and logically belongs under it. You can learn more about this in our guide on [Parent-child Cards](/cards/creating-cards/#parent-child-cards).

* Use Relations when both entities exist independently but need to be linked to reflect their interaction or connection. Relations don't imply a hierarchical structure, just that the entities are related in some way.
