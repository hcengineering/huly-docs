description: Learn about Relations in the Cards system.

<div className="rounded-box">
  <h5><strong>What is a Relation?</strong></h5>
  <p>A Relation defines a connection between Cards, linking information across the system. Relations are created between Types in Settings before any Cards exist, establishing predefined associations. Once Cards are created, they can be connected through these Relations, forming a structured and interconnected knowledge base.</p>
</div>

Relations allow you to connect Cards and define their interactions in a way that reflects real-world relationships. This allows you to:

* **Build networks of interconnected data** - Relations help create a web of linked information, allowing you to easily explore how various entities relate to one another. This interconnectedness makes it possible to visualize complex systems and understand the structure of information.
* **Optimize data navigation** - Relations make it easy to navigate between associated Cards, making it easier to find relevant information quickly.

In our **game design** example, a `Character` Card may be related to an `Item` Card that the character posesses, or a `Game Asset` Card could be related to a `Game Component` that it's used for.

To learn how these relationships work in practice, check out our guides on [Defining Relations](/cards/relations/defining-relations) and [Relating Cards](/cards/relations/relating-cards).
