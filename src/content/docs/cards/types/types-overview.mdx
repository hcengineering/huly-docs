  <h5><strong>What is a Type?</strong></h5>
  <p>A Type is a blueprint that defines the structure and properties of a Card. It specifies the attributes each Card will have, ensuring consistency and organization across the system. Types can also be derived to create variations with unique properties.</p>

Types define the structure of information within the system. Think of a Type as a blueprint that outlines the specific details you'll need to store for each piece of information.

In our **game design** example, we have four core Types:

1. **`Game System`** - Major gameplay and technical systems in the game
2. **`Game Component`** - Physical or digital elements in the game world
3. **`Document`** - Written design, technical and narrative information
4. **`Asset`** - Digital files used in the game, such as images, sounds, textures and 3D models. This Type is based on the default `File` Type (see [File Types](/docs/cards/types/file-types)).

Each **Type** has a set of **properties** that define the specific details we want to capture for each piece of information. For instance, our `Game Component` Type has properties like "Name" and "Description":

- **`Game Component`**
  - Name
  - Description

We can also derive Types to define variations that have their own unique properties. For example, in our game design system, we may want to derive several new Types from the `Game Component` Type, each with their own set of properties:

- **`Game Component`**
  - Name
  - Description
  - **`ðŸ‘¤ Character`**
    - Role (player, enemy, NPC)
  - **`ðŸŽ’ Item`**
    - Item type (weapon, consumable, key item)
    - Effect
    - Rarity (common, rare, legendary)
  - **`ðŸŒŽ Environment`**
    - Size (small, medium, large)
    - Interactive?
  - **`ðŸŽ¨ UI Element`**
    - Function
