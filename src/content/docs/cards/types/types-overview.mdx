  <h5><strong>What is a Type?</strong></h5>
  <p>A Type is a blueprint that defines the structure and properties of a Card. It specifies the attributes each Card will have, ensuring consistency and organization across the system. Types can also be derived to create variations with unique properties.</p>

Types define the structure of information within the system. Think of a Type as a blueprint that outlines the specific details you'll need to store for each piece of information.

In our **game design** example, we have three core Types:

2. **`Game Component`** - Physical or digital elements in the game world
3. **`Document`** - Written design, technical and narrative information. This is a default system `Document` Type.
4. **`File`** - Digital files used in the game, such as images, sounds, textures and 3D models. This is a default system `File` Type (see [File Types](/cards/types/file-types)).

Each **Type** has a set of **properties** that define the specific details we want to capture for each piece of information.

We can also derive Types to define variations that have their own unique properties. To learn how to create Types and derived Types in practice, check out our next guide on [Creating Types](/cards/types/creating-types).
