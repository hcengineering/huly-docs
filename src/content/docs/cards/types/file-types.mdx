The Huly Cards system comes with a special default Type called **`File`**. This basic Type allows you to manage files, such as images, videos, PDFs and other media.

The `File` Type behaves the same as any other Type, with a few key differences:

1. The `File` Type **cannot be deleted**.
2. Cards created from the `File` Type (or derivations of the `File` Type) include a **designated area for uploading files**.

You can think of the `File` Type as the foundation for an advanced file drive system. Rather than uploading files to a single drive and organizing them into folders, you can create a Type for each category of files you want to manage and define their shared properties.

## Deriving Types from `File`

To create new Types derived from `File`, navigate to Settings, select `File` under `TYPES` in the left sidebar, and click the `+` button in the `Types` area.

Creating a Type derived from `File` the same as creating any other derived Type (see steps for [creating derived Types](/cards/types/creating-types/#creating-derived-types)).

In our **game design** example, we'll create two Types derived from `File` to manage different categories of game assets, each with their own properties:

- **`File`**
  - **`Game Asset`**
    - Name
    - Description
    - Formats
    - **`üñºÔ∏è Image Asset`**
      - Dimensions (px)
      - Transparency? (yes/no)
    - **`üîä Audio Asset`**
      - Purpose (soundtrack, sound effect)
      - Duration (s)
      - Looping? (yes/no)

## Creating Cards from `File` Types

Creating Cards from `File` Types is the same as creating Cards from any other Type (see our guide for [Creating Cards](/cards/creating-cards)) ‚Äî when you create a Card from a `File` Type, however, you'll see a designated area for uploading files.

Here, you can click the upload button or drop your files into the upload area.

  Below is an example of a Card created from the `Audio Asset` Type:

## Tips for using the `File` Type

The `File` Type is a powerful tool for managing files in your Huly workspace. Here are some tips for getting the most out of it:

* **Create your custom file system** - Create different Types for various categories of files to ensure everything is neatly organized in one place.
* **Collaborate on media assets** - Use the `File` Type to store media that you may need to discuss with the team or add context to within the editor.
* **[Relations](/cards/relations/relations-overview)** - Link your files to other Cards in your knowledge management system to establish connections between related resources.
* **Track metadata** - Define useful properties for each Type, such as dimensions, duration, or format, to make it easier to filter and organize files based on their characteristics.

## Other ways to connect files to Cards
In addition to using the `File` Type, there are several other ways to link files and media to Cards. There are advantages to each method, so choose the combination that works best for you!

* **Card attachments** - Attach files to any Card, regardless of its Type, by adding them directly to the Card‚Äôs interface (see [Creating Cards](/cards/cards/creating-cards) for an example). This is a great way to quickly attach a file that doesn't need its own dedicated Card.
* **Inline embeds** - Use the `/` shortcut in the collaborative editor to embed images directly within the content. This is useful for adding visual elements to text-based Cards.
* **Comment attachments** - You can also attach files to specific comments within the activity section, which is handy when you need to send a resource or snapshot with your message.
