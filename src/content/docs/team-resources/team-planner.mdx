### Navigating the team planner

The team planner in Huly provides a way to visualize your team's agenda at a glance. To navigate to the team planner, click the sun icon in the left side navigation bar.

The team planner breaks the agenda down by project, and you can find each of your project listed on the left side panel. This design allows teams with multiple projects to easily see all of the work planned for each project. This structure also ensures project privacy, as team members will only be able to view the planner for projects they are a member of, while the workspace owner will be able to view all projects.

##### Agenda & calendar views

By default, the team planner shows the agenda view of the previous and current day. You can scroll through the days using the arrow buttons in the top right corner, viewing 2 days at a time as you scroll.

The calendar view displays either a daily or weekly calendar of each team member's tasks. In the daily calendar, tasks are displayed as blocks, and can be viewed in 1-hour or 30-minute increments. The weekly calendar displays each team member's tasks on each day of the week.

### Visibility settings for action items

By default, when a team member schedules an action item in the their personal planner (see [Scheduling action items](/task-tracking/scheduling-action-items)), it will automatically become visible on the team planner for all other team members. The title of the action item, associated issue, and number of hours scheduled are all visible. Clicking the dropdown arrow by that task will also reveal the specific time block the action item is scheduled for.

If the team member has set the visibility of their action item to "Only visible to you", it will not appear in the team planner.

### Visibility settings for events

Events on a team member's personal planner will also appear in the team planner, depending on the visibility settings.

If the visibility is set to "Visible to everyone", everyone on the team will be able to see the title, time and duration of the event. If the visibility is set to "FreeBusy", team members will be able to see that person is busy during that time, but they won't be able to see the name of the event.

Just like action items, if the visibility is set to "Only visible to you", the event will not appear in the team planner.
