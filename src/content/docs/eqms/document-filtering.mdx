description: Learn how to filter documents and create saved filtered views.
---

To create a filtered view of your documents, navigate to the `Library` sub-menu of the Controlled Documents module. From here, click the `Filter` button at the top toolbar and select the criteria you'd like to filter by. For example, you may wish to create a view of documents created by a specific person, or documents created within a certain date range.

After setting your filters, click the `Save as` button in the top right corner. Give your filtered view a name, decide if you'd like your view to be private or public, and click `Save`.

Saved filtered views are accessible from the left sidebar.
