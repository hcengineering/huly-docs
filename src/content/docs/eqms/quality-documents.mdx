Quality documents are a part of the Controlled Documents module and are used for managing quality-related documents, such as standard operating procedures and work instructions.

### Creating a quality document

To create a quality document, open the settings menu next to `QUALITY DOCUMENTS` in the left sidebar and select `Create new document`. 

<div style="position: relative; padding-top: 52.43393602225312%;">

    allow="accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;"
    allowfullscreen="true"
  ></iframe>
</div>

It's also possible to create a quality document by clicking the blue `+ New document` button in the top left corner of the Controlled Documents module and then selecting `Quality documents` as the space.

> **Note:** A new quality document can also be created as a child of any existing document.

Proceed through the following steps to create the document:

**Step 1:** Select a space and parent for your document. The space defines the roles and permissions that will apply; the parent simply determines where the document will be stored. A document can be the direct child of the space itself (at the top level of the space), or it can be a child of a document within that space.

**Step 2:** Select a template for your document. See our guide on [templates](/eqms/templates) for more information about how to create reusable templates for controlled documents.
