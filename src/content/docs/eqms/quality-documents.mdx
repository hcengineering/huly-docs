Quality documents are a part of the Controlled Documents module and are used for managing quality-related documents, such as standard operating procedures and work instructions.

### Creating a quality document

To create a quality document, open the settings menu next to `QUALITY DOCUMENTS` in the left sidebar and select `Create new document`.

  <source src="/src/assets/videos/eqms/docs-quality-create.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

It's also possible to create a quality document by clicking the blue `+ New document` button in the top left corner of the Controlled Documents module and then selecting `Quality documents` as the space.

> **Note:** A new quality document can also be created as a child of any existing document.

Proceed through the following steps to create the document:

**Step 1:** Select a space and parent for your document. The space defines the roles and permissions that will apply; the parent simply determines where the document will be stored. A document can be the direct child of the space itself (at the top level of the space), or it can be a child of a document within that space.

**Step 2:** Select a template for your document. See our guide on [templates](../templates) for more information about how to create reusable templates for controlled documents.

**Step 3:** Provide details for your document, including a title, description, and reason for document creation.

**Step 4:** Select team members that will be working on the document, including Co-Authors, Reviewers, and Approvers.

After proceeding through the above steps, click `Create Draft`.
