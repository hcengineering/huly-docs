Technical documentation is part of the Controlled Documents module and is used for managing product development records, such as test reports and requirement documents.

### Creating a technical document

To create a new technical document, open the settings menu next to any product space within the `TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION` submenu in the left sidebar and select `Create new document`. You can also click the `+ New document` button in the controlled documents module. 

> **Note:** A new technical document can also be created as a child of any existing document.

Proceed through the following steps to create the document:

**Step 1:** Select a space and parent for your document. The space defines the roles and permissions that will apply; the parent simply determines where the document will be stored. A document can be the direct child of the space itself (at the top level of the space), or it can be a child of a document within that space.

**Step 2:** Select a template for your document. See our guide on eQMS [templates](/eqms/templates) for more information about how to create reusable templates for controlled documents.
