description: Learn the difference between the owner and author of a document.

A document `Author` is the one who creates and signs the document, who will be listed on the PDF at export. The `Owner`, on the other hand, is the person who is responsible for drafting and managing the document throughout its lifecycle. In most cases, the same user will act as both the `Author` and the `Owner` of a document, but there may be times at which you need to transfer ownership to someone else.

The `Owner` can be changed from the `...` menu in the top right corner, or by selecting the current owner's name in the right side panel and clicking `Select new owner`.
