## Settings within documents

There are several settings available for controlled documents, found in the navigational tabs at the top of the document as well as in the right side panel. These settings are the same for all types of controlled documents, including templates, quality documents and technical documentation.

- **Reason & Impact:** Under the `Reason & Impact` tab, you can provide information on changes. This section is used to explain why the document was created or changed, and what impact it will have. The `Description` and `Reason` fields will be automatically populated in the `History` section of the document.

- **Team:** Under the `Team` tab, you can add or remove team members as Co-Authors, Reviewers, and Approvers.

- **Release details:** Under the `Release` tab, you can provide information on the release of the document, including the severity of the release (decimal change for minor updates; whole number change for major updates), and the effective date.

- **Trainings:** Also under the `Release` tab is the option to add a training.

- **History:** Under the `History` tab, you can view a log of changes made to the document, including the date and description of each change.

## Relocating and reordering documents

Controlled documents can be relocated and reordered within their current space, or transferred to a different space with some additional configurations.

To move a controlled document within the same space, simply drag and drop them in the left side panel. To nest a document within another, drag and drop it over the new parent document.

To transfer a document to a different space, click on the settings menu next to the document in the left side panel and select `Transfer`.

Next, select a space to transfer to, as well as the parent object for your document (if applicable). Click `Transfer` again to transfer the document.

> **Note:** Some team members may lose the ability to view or edit the document after transferring it, depending on the permissions settings for the destination space. Documents can only be moved if they're created in the current product version. Additionally, the user making the transfer must have archive rights in the source space and document creation rights in the destination space.
