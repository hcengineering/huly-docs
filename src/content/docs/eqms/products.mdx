New products can be created within the Products module. Products are used to represent physical or digital products that your organization produces, and can be linked to other objects in TraceX.

### Creating a product

To create a product, click the `+ Product` button in the Products module.

Provide a title and description, and select members and roles as needed. Then, click `Create`.

### Creating a product version

> **Note:** In order to create a new version of a product, you'll need to have an effective Change Control document that uses a Change Control template. To learn more about this step, see this guide on creating [templates](/eqms/templates).

To create a new version of a product from within the Products module, open the details page for the product you'll be adding a version to. Then, click the `+` button beside the `Product Versions` section.

From here, you'll be able to provide a name and description for the new version, and select if the change is substantial or not (minor or major). You'll also be able to select your Change Control document from the dropdown menu.

After providing the necessary details, click `Create`. The new version will be added to the product's version history.
