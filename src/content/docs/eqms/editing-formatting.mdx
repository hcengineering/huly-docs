While each type of controlled document is created through slightly different steps, all controlled documents have the same options available for editing and formatting.

Just like any other document in your workspace, you can use tags, attachments, images, tables, and other markdown formatting to customize your document. The following features are also available:

**Comments:** Highlight text and select the speech bubble icon.

Comments can be viewed together in the right side panel, where they can be filtered and sorted.
