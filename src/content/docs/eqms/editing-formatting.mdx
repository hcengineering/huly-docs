While each type of controlled document is created through slightly different steps, all controlled documents have the same options available for editing and formatting.

Just like any other document in your workspace, you can use tags, attachments, images, tables, and other markdown formatting to customize your document. The following features are also available:

**Comments:** Highlight text and select the speech bubble icon. 

<video controls>
  <source src="/src/assets/videos/eqms/docs-comment.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

Comments can be viewed together in the right side panel, where they can be filtered and sorted.

**Sections:** Open the `...` menu beside the section title and choose to add a new section above or below, or delete or duplicate the current section.

**Description:** Also accessible from the `...` menu next to each section, you can add a short description that will help guide users on what to include in that section. Descriptions appear highlighted in green just below the section title.

**Guidance:** Like the description, guidance provides further details on what should be included in a section. Instead of being displayed under the section title, guidance can be hidden or displayed by clicking on the `i` icon beside the section title. This makes it a useful tool for adding longer reference information that may need to be reviewed when writing the document.

**Export to PDF:** From the settings menu in the top right corner, select `Print to PDF`. PDFs are 21 CFR Part 11 compliant.
