### Creating a new document version

As a document owner, you can create a new version of your document by selecting `Draft new version`. With the draft open, you can make any necessary changes to the content, provide information about the new version in under the `Reason & Impact` tab, and update team members and release info.

Selecting `Comparing` from the top right corner allows you to compare changes across document versions, displaying additions highlighted in green and deletions in red.

Once the approval process for a document is completed, you'll have a version 0.2 Effective document, with the `History` section auto-populated with the information you entered in `Reason & Impact`.
