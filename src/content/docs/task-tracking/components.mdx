## What are components?

Components are essentially a way to categorize issues within a project - similar to [labels](/task-tracking/labels), but with a key difference: an issue can only belong to one component, whereas many labels can be added to a single issue.

For example, components could be used to organize issues into categories like "UI", "Core", "Backend", etc.

## How are components different from milestones?

[Milestones](/task-tracking/milestones) are more useful when planning parts of a project related to timing or phases of work. Milestones move through the states Planned > In Progress > Completed, while components are simply used for categorizing issues around a topic or area.

## Using components

Just like other objects in Huly, components can have a description and attachments. Every component also has an activity section connected to chat, so team members can have discussions related to the component.

### Creating components

Navigate to `Components` in the left side menu of the Tracker, under the project in which you'd like to create the component. Then, click the `+ Component` button in the top right corner.

Add a title and optional description, and select a member as the Lead if applicable. Then, click `Create component`.

### Connecting issues to components

On the component page, you can create a new issue to attach to that component by clicking the `+` button in the "Issues" section. The issue you create will be automatically connected to that component.

You can also connect an existing issue to the component by navigating to the issue's page and selecting the component in the right side menu.

When creating a new issue from anywhere in the tracker, you can also select the component from the dropdown menu in the issue creation dialog.

### Using components to filter issues

Components can be used in the same way as milestones and labels for filtering and sorting issues in the Tracker. For more detailed steps, see [Viewing issues](/task-tracking/viewing-issues).
