### What are action items?

Action items are tasks that are assigned to a specific team member. They are created automatically when an issue is created with a status of "Todo" and assigned to a team member. Action items are added to the member's Planner, where they can be scheduled and tracked.

Action items are a unique feature of the Huly platform. You can learn more about the concept behind action items (previously called "todos") on our <a href="https://huly.blog/huly-todos" target="_blank">blog</a>. Action items are also covered more in depth in our tutorial video:

### Creating action items

Action items can be created automatically, manually in your own Planner, or directly from within documents.

##### Action items automatically created for an issue
An action item is automatically generated by the system when an issue is created with an assignee and the status set to “Todo”. This action item will appear in the Planner of the assignee, and a notification will appear in their inbox. This is the recommended way to create an action item because it directly links to the issue and allows for tracking of the issue's status, while ensuring an individual team member is responsible for the action item's completion.

##### Creating an action item in your Planner
Action items can be created in your own personal Planner without being attached to any particular project or issue. Creating an action item in this way may be helpful for a team member to manage small personal tasks that don't directly relate to an issue and don't necessarily need to be visible to the rest of the team.

To create an action item in your Planner:
* Navigate to the Planner view by clicking on the calendar icon in the left sidebar.
* Click on the text field and enter a title for your action item; press enter to save. Your new action item should now appear in your Planner in the “Unplanned” section.

##### Assigning action items directly from a document
For more on creating and assigning action items directly within documents, check out this [guide](../../knowledge-management/documents-action-items).

### Completing an action item

When the task associated with an action item is complete, the action item can be marked as complete by clicking the round checkbox that appears when hovering over the action item on the Planner. This will change the status of the associated issue to “Done” and will move the action item to the "Done" section of the Planner.
