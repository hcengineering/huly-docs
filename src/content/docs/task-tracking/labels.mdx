## Using labels in the Tracker

Labels can be used to categorize issues in the Tracker, making it easier to filter issues to find what you need. Labels can be added and removed when creating the issue, or after the fact in the right side panel.

When viewing issues in your tracker, you can toggle whether or not to display labels for each issue by clicking `Customize view` and then clicking the toggle for `Labels`.

To filter for all issues with a certain label, click `Filter` and select `Labels`, then check off any labels which should be included in your filter.

## Managing labels

To manage your labels, navigate to `Labels` in the left side panel of the Tracker. From here, you can add, edit, and delete labels.

* **Adding a label** - Click `+ Add label` in the top right corner. Enter a title and description, select a color and click `Create`.
* **Editing a label** - Click on the label you wish to edit, make your changes, and click `Save`.
* **Deleting a label** - Right-click on the label and click `Delete`.

From here, you can also see how many issues are associated with each issue. Click on the column to sort by your most frequently used labels.
