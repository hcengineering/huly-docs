## Creating a new document version

As a Controlled Document owner, you can create a new version of your document by selecting `Draft new version`. With the draft open, you can make any necessary changes to the content, provide information about the new version in under the `Reason & Impact` tab, and update team members and release info.

Selecting `Comparing` from the top right corner allows you to compare changes across document versions, displaying additions highlighted in green and deletions in red.

Once the approval process for a document is completed, you'll have a version 0.2 Effective document, with the `History` section auto-populated with the information you entered in `Reason & Impact`.

> **Note:** Document metadata is now editable during the initial document version draft phase, allowing users to modify the document ID, template prefix, and category before finalization. This ensures flexibility in case of errors during the creation process.

## Marking a document as obsolete

To mark a document as obsolete, open the settings menu and select `Mark as obsolete`. Obsolete documents are marked with a red label, removed from active document lists, and cannot be used to create new versions (the `Draft a new version` button is disabled).
