Surveys are new to Huly and still in experimental development. In the future, you'll be able to use surveys for many purposes, such as gathering feedback from team members and creating trainings and onboarding processes. There may be many more use cases for surveys in Huly, and we welcome any ideas or input you have at this early stage.

For now, surveys can be used for:

* Brainstorming ideas for surveys you might use in the future
* Drafting survey questions to share with your team for feedback
* Discussing drafts of surveys using the Activity section below the survey

Below is an example of a survey in preview mode:

## Creating a survey

Select `Survey Forms` in the left side menu of the Survey module, then click the `+ Survey` button in the top right corner. Enter a title for your survey an click `Create`. After opening your survey, you can optionally add a description below the title.

## Adding questions

Begin by typing a question in the Questions area and press Enter. From here, you can select the type of question you want to add:

* Simple answer (text field)
* Select an option (single-select radio buttons)
* Select several options (multi-select checkboxes)

You can also set whether the field will be mandatory, and if you want to allow for a write-in custom option (only available for single-select and multi-select questions).

In the current implementation, it is not yet possible to indicate correct and incorrect answers, but this will be added in a future version.

## Previewing the survey

Click the `Preview` button in the top right corner to see how your survey would look.

For now, there is no option to share surveys directly; however, you may choose to send a link to team members and have discussions in the Activity section below the survey.
