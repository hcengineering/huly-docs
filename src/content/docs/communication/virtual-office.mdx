The Huly platform offers the ability for team members to meet through built-in voice and video conferencing. To access the Live Office Virtual Environment, click the building icon in the left sidebar.

### Navigating your virtual office

The virtual office contains three kinds of rooms:
* **Individual offices** - Each team member has their own office space. Other users are required to knock before entering. Audio and screen sharing are available.
* **Team rooms** - These rooms are for voice calls only, support screen sharing, and do not require knocking to enter, although this setting can be overridden. Team rooms are ideal for quick meetings with more than 2 team members.
* **Meeting rooms** - These rooms are for video conferencing. Audio-only is also possible, and screen sharing is supported. Meeting rooms do not require knocking to enter, although this setting can be overridden. Meeting rooms are perfect for larger meetings or presentations.


### Individual offices

At the bottom of the screen, you can choose the privacy setting for your own personal office:
* **Knock required** - Others must request access by knocking before entering.
* **Do not disturb** - Others are unable to request access to your office.

##### Entering someone else's office
Click on any team member's office to request to enter. You'll see a dialog indicating that you are knocking on their virtual office door, and you'll need to wait to be allowed to enter.

##### Letting someone into your own office
When someone is requesting to enter your office, you'll see a popup with their image and name. Select `Accept` to begin a voice call, or `Decline`.

### Team and meeting rooms

Team and meeting rooms are available for meetings with more than 2 participants. Team rooms allow for audio only, while meeting rooms support video conferencing. Both room types allow for screen sharing and various access settings.

Click on any meeting room to enter. Inside the meeting room, a few options are available at the bottom of the screen:

* **Change access** - Select either open, knock required or do not disturb.
* **Audio** - Mute or unmute, and change settings for speaker, microphone and noise cancellation.
* **Video** - Turn camera on or off, and change settings for which camera to use and how much to blur the background.
* **Share** - Share all or part of your screen with everyone in the room.
* **Leave room** - Exit the meeting room.


### Editing your office space

While Huly's virtual office comes with default offices and meeting rooms, team may wish to customize the number of rooms and office layout to best suit their needs. Only the creator of he Workspace is able to edit the office space.

Click the `Edit office` button in the top right corner. A few options are available for editing: 
* Rename offices and rooms by clickin on their names.
* Delete offices and rooms by clicking the trash bin icon.
* Arrange offices and rooms by clicking and dragging their edges or draggin them to a new place in the layout.
* Add a new office or room by clicking the `+` button in the top right corner.

When you have finished editing your office place, click `Finalize editing` in the top right corner to save your changes.

### Floors

Large teams may find that the default layout may not have sufficient space for their offices and rooms. Additional floors can be added to the virtual office by clicking the `+` button on the Floors sidebar.

If the Floors sidebar is not visible, either collapse the Main view by clicking the icon in the top left corner, or click on the two horizontal lines below your Workspace icon at the top of the left sidebar.

To add a new Floor, click the `+` icon in the top right corner of the Floors sidebar. Enter a name for the new Floor and click `Add a floor`.

### Office preview
At any time, from any view in the Huly platform, you can glance at your virtual office space by selecting `Main` in the top left corner of the screen. This opens a popup displaying your virtual office, including which team members are in which areas. To join an office or room, however, you'll need to navigate to the full view using the building icon in the left sidebar.
