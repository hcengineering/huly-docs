Huly offers many options for team members to communicate directly within the Huly platform without the need for an external app. Hulyâ€™s chat functionality allows team members to exchange messages in real time through direct messaging and shared channels. 

This guide covers how to exchange messages with your team using Chat. Chat is also integrated with the rest of your workspace, so documents, issues, pull requests and other workspace objects can be accessed alongside your other conversations. For more on how Chat integrates other workspace activity, see our guide on [activity tracking in chat](../chat-activity).

### Ways to chat

There are a few different ways to chat with team members on Huly:
* **Channels** - Public or private chatrooms based on topics or themes
* **Direct messages** - Instant messaging between individuals or groups
* **Other workspace objects** - From Chat, you can access all activity on documents, issues, files and more. Read more in our guide on [activity tracking in chat](../chat-activity).

### Creating a channel

Create a new channel by clicking the `+` button at the top of the Chat sidebar and selecting `New channel`. Enter a name and description for your channel and select either `Public` or `Private` for visibility. Click `Create`.

After you've created your channel, there will be a few additional settings available in the right sidebar:

* **Rename** - Click the channel name to rename it.
* **Members** - To make your channel visible to other team members in their own Chat, add them to the channel by clicking `Add members` in the right sidebar.
* **Auto join** - Toggle this setting to automatically add all new workspace members to this channel.

### Creating a direct message

Create a new direct message by clicking the `+` button at the top of the Chat sidebar and selecting `New direct chat`. Select the user you'd like to chat with and click `Create`.

### Chat options

Like everywhere else in your Huly workspace, chat messages support markdown formatting, attachments, mentions, emojis and text templates. 

Hover over any message to add a reaction, pin it to the top of the chat, or reply in a chat thread:
