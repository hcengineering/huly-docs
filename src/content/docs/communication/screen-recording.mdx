Recording your screen is a great way to share information with your team. Huly makes it easy to record your screen and save the recording directly to your Huly Drive, without relying on an external service like Loom or Screencastify. Soon, you'll be able to use screen recordings in Huly to quickly and easily send bug reports to the Huly team.

## Creating a screen recording

To begin a screen recording, click the `REC` button in the top right corner of the global toolbar. You'll have a chance to select some settings before you start recording:

- **Microphone** - Select the microphone input, or turn it off if you don't want to record audio.
- **Camera** - Turning off the camera will switch to display your avatar only in the bottom-left corner of the recording. Hover over your avatar and click the `X` icon to close it entirely.
- **Avatar/Camera size** - Select from three sizes for your video camera or avatar in the bottom-left corner of the recording.

Once you're ready, click `Record`. Select the tab, window or entire screen to record, and click `Share`. Your recording will begin immediately.

## During the recording

When recording is in progress, you'll notice the `REC` button in the top right corner of the global toolbar is red. You'll also see next to your avatar a timer showing how long you've been recording. The following options are also available:

- **Pause** - Click the pause icon to pause the recording. You can resume at any time by clicking the play icon.
- **Stop** - Click the stop icon to end the recording. Your recording will automatically be saved to your Huly Drive.
- **Restart** - Click the restart icon to stop the recording and start a new one. This will discard the current recording.

## Accessing your screen recordings

Your screen recordings are saved to your Huly Drive, where you can access them at any time. To find your recordings, navigate to the `Drive` section in the sidebar and look for the `Screen Recordings` folder. Here, you'll see all of your recordings organized by date.

## Sharing your screen recordings

There are a few ways to share screen recordings:

1. **From the recording page** - in Drive, open your recording. Use the comments section to @mention team members with whom you'd like to share the recording.
2. **From chats** - in any chat, simply @mention the screen recording to send a link. (_Note:_ Screen recordings are saved with a default title including the time and date, but you can rename them in Drive for easier reference.)

Soon, you'll be able to share screen recordings directly with the Huly team to report bugs or send feedback. Until this feature is available, you can download your recordings from Huly to send via Slack or email.
