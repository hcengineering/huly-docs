In Huly Chat, your team can communicate through direct messaging and group chat channels and collaborate on projects and resources. This guide covers how to view and track workspace activity within chat, including documents, issues, pull requests and other workspace objects. For more on sending chat messages through channels and DMs, see our guide on [sending messages](/communication/sending-messages).

## Viewing workspace activity in chat

Documents, issues and other workspace objects appear in Chat for all associated team members, so members can see updates, discuss details and make decisions alongside the rest of their chat conversations.

In the left sidebar of your chat, you'll find sections labeled `Documents`, `Issues`, and any other task types you've created. These sections will display all of the associated objects that you've either created, been assigned, or been mentioned in.

Outside of Chat, you'll notice that many objects in Huly (like issues and documents) have an Activity section where you can have discussions through comments. Comments that are added here in the Activity section will also appear in the chat associated with that object.

### Filtering activity

After opening a workspace object in Chat, use the filter button in the top right corner to filter for the specific activity you want to see. For example, you can filter to only see comments to create a chat-like view of all of the discussion related to that object. Or, filter by attributes to only see changes to the object details without comments.

### Viewing object details

Open the right sidebar to view the details of the object you're viewing. This provides a quick overview of the object's status, assignee, due date and other relevant details without leaving the chat view. From here, you can click the expand icon to open a full view of the object.

### Syncing with GitHub

If you've connected a project to GitHub, you'll see a special `Pull Requests` section in your chat sidebar. This section will display all of the pull requests associated with your project, and you can open any pull request to see the activity history and comments. Just like comments and activity on the task itself, anything added here in the chat will sync with GitHub.

## Mentioning Huly objects in Chat

When you use the `@` symbol to mention an object in a Huly chat channel or DM, your message will automatically appear in the Activity section of that object. These mentioned issues will only be visible to the members of the chat channel or DM, and will not be visible to other members of the workspace. For example, if you and a colleague have a private chat about an issue in your DMs, you'll see the messages that include the `@` tag in the Activity section of that issue, but other members of the workspace will won't be able to see it.
