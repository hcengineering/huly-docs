description: Learn how to keep track of workspace activity within chat.

Chat is the central communication hub at the core of Huly, where team members can communicate not only through direct messaging and group chat channels, but also collaborate on projects and resources. Documents, issues and other workspace objects appear in the chat of all associated team members, so members can see updates, discuss details and make decisions alongside the rest of their chat conversations.

## Viewing workspace activity in chat

In the left sidebar of your chat, you'll find sections labeled `Documents`, `Issues`, and any other task types you've created. These sections will display all of the associated objects that you've either created, been assigned, or been mentioned in.

Open any object to see the activity history. Issues and other task types will also display any comments that have been added. Sending a message from this view will automatically add a comment to that issue or task, and vice versa â€” comments added to an issue will appear in the chat associated with the object.

### Filtering activity

Use the filter button in the top right corner to filter for the specific activity you want to see. For example, you can filter to only see comments to create a chat-like view of all of the discussion related to that object. Or, filter by attributes to only see changes to the object details without comments.

### Viewing object details

Open the right sidebar to view the details of the object you're viewing. This provides a quick overview of the object's status, assignee, due date and other details without leaving the chat view. From here, you can click the expand icon to open a full view of the object.

### Syncing with GitHub

If you've connected a project to GitHub, you'll see a special `Pull Requests` section in your chat sidebar. This section will display all of the pull requests associated with your project, and you can open any pull request to see the activity history and comments. Just like comments and activity on the task itself, anything added here in the chat will sync with GitHub.
