Tasks in your workspace can be directly connected to people in your Contacts list. There are several cases where this can be useful, for example:

- **Working with clients** - Freelancers, agencies and businesses using Huly to manage client projects may choose to connect tasks in their Tracker to client contacts. This allows tasks to be linked to the client's contact information, making it easy to keep track of who to contact for updates, feedback or approvals.

- **Scheduling follow ups** - Keep track of follow up conversations by creating tasks in your Tracker that are connected to your external contacts. Keep notes on your interactions and set reminders for when to follow up.

- **Tracking support requests** - If you're using Huly to manage support requests, you can connect tasks to the contact who submitted the request. This makes it easy to see all tasks related to a specific contact, and keep track of the status of their requests.

## Creating a new issue

To create an issue directly from a contact, open the dropdown settings menu on their contact page and select `New related issue`. This will open a dialog to create a new issue.

When the issue is created, a `Related` field will appear in the details sidebar. Here, you can see the contact connected to this issue.

## Connecting an existing issue

To connect an existing issue to a contact, open the issue and open the dropdown settings menu. Select `Relations` and then `Reference another issue`. From here, you can choose a contact to connect to the issue.

> **Note:** You can also connect other issues, documents and tasks here!

## Viewing connected issues

To view all of the issues related to a contact, navigate to the Tracker and select `All issues`. Use the `Filter` button to select `Related to` and then choose the name of the contact whose issues you'd like to see.
