There are three types of contacts in Huly:
* **Employee** - a member of your workspace
* **Person** - an external contact
* **Company** - a company or organization

These Contact types are used to help you organize members of your workspace alongside external contacts, like clients, leads, GitHub collaborators and more. You can manage your Contacts from the Contacts page in your workspace.

### Adding contacts

Contacts can be added using the `+` button in the top right corner of the Contacts page. For more on adding employees to your workspace, see this guide on managing [employees](../employees).

To add an external contact, click the `+ Person` button and enter their name and email address. This will create a new contact in your Contacts list. From here, you can add notes, attachments, social links and additional information related to the contact.

### Customizing your Contacts list

You can customize the kind of information you wish to store for people in your Contacts list. For example, you may wish to add information like how you met, their pronouns, their preferred method of contact, or other specific details. 

To add custom fields to your contacts, click the cog icon in the top right corner of the details sidebar. You can also access this page by navigating to `Settings` and selecting `Classes` and then `Person`. Here, you can add any fields you like to your contacts.

Just like any other fields for contacts, your custom fields can also be used to filter and sort contacts on your list.

### Deleting contacts

Contacts can be deleted by right-clicking on the contact and selecting `Delete`. This option is also available from the dropdown settings on the contact's individual page.
