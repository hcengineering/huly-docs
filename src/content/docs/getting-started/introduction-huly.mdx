Huly is an open source all-in-one project management platform offering an alternative to tools like Linear, Jira, Slack, Notion, and Motion.

By providing a powerful suite of features including workflow management, personal scheduling, collaborative editing and video conferencing, Huly streamlines project management processes in a way that aligns seamlessly with the complexity and dynamic nature of real-world workflows.

### Where we're headed

As we hone in on our goals for the future of the Huly platform, we're focusing on creating a better system for process management system that actually reflects real, dynamic workflows. We're re-working the entire framework of the Huly platform not only to support this goal but also to lay the foundation for our vision of a global Huly that will be the only tool anyone will ever need to manage their work.

Our development is largely driven by user feedback, and we're committed to delivering an exceptional user experience while making room for fresh ideas and a different way of looking at the tools that have failed to fit the bill in the past. Welcome to Huly -- We're excited to grow with you.
