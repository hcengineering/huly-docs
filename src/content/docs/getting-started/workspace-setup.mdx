### Creating your first workspace

When you first sign up for an account on Huly or TraceX, you will be prompted to create a workspace.

Your workspace represents the virtual office space where your team will be working. Fully customizable to your team's unique needs, your workspace serves as a central hub for communication, project planning, task tracking and collaboration.

Give your workspace a great name and click `Create`.

### Inviting team members to your workspace

Once your workspace has been created, you can invite team members to join.

Select your profile icon on the bottom left of the sidebar. Then, select `Invite to workspace`. Select `Get invite link` to reveal the invite link. From there, you can copy the link, which you can share with your team members.

It's also possible to invite new members to your workspace by adding them directly as employees in the Contacts module. Navigate to Contacts and select Employee in the left side menu. Click the `+ Employee` button and enter a name and email address for the person you want to invite. An email invitation will be sent to the email address you entered.

> **Note:** Under the current version of Huly, new members are not automatically added to projects and teamspaces unless you select the `auto join` toggle for those spaces. This helps you maintain control over who has access to the data within your workspace when new members join.

##### Configuring invite settings

Workspace invite links come with some default settings. To configure these settings, open the settings panel by clicking on the horizontal marks at the top left of the sidebar. Select `Invite settings` in the settings panel. Here, you can configure settings for your workspace invitations, including the duration the link will be valid for, email mask and limit.

While anybody can send and email invitation, the email mask can be used by the workspace owner to restrict access to your workspace by only allowing users with specific email domains to join. For example, if you only want users with email addresses from your company domain to join your workspace, you can set the email mask to `@yourcompany.com`.
  
### Workspace settings

To configure workspace settings, open the settings panel by clicking on the horizontal marks at the top left of the sidebar. The following are some basic settings that can be configured:

* **General**: Add a custom logo for your workspace, or change the workspace name.
* **Owners**: Set roles for all team members as User, Maintainer or Owner. To learn more about roles, see [this guide](/advanced-settings/roles). 
* **Invite settings**: Configure settings for workspace invitations.

You can also set the language for your workspace. Click the flag icon in the top right corner and select your preferred language.
