## Plans for the Huly mobile app

We are eager to introduce our mobile app to the Huly platform but are still in the early stages of development and are not able to share a specific ETA at this time.

We're working on big infrastructure changes that will profoundly impact the way users interact with Huly â€” particularly through our implementation of Global Huly, where you can manage your communications and work under your global user account. This, in addition to the development of new designs, are important steps towards introducing our mobile app. 

Check out this preview of early design ideations for our mobile app (and other exciting concepts):

## Accessing Huly and receiving notifications from your mobile device

Until we have a mobile app, you can access most of your Huly workspace through the browser on a mobile device, and we're continuing to make improvements to the UI for mobile access.

There are currently two ways to receive Huly notifications on your phone:
1. On iPhone, use Safari to add the Huly web app to your phone desktop, then use webpush to receive notifications. Some views in the interface may not be optimized for mobile yet, but you can still access chat, inbox and several other modules.
2. Use the Telegram app to connect with our bot. By connecting your workspace to Telegram, you can receive notifications, send chat messages and reply to threads without ever needing to open Huly. See our [Telegram integration guide](/integrations/telegram) for more information.
