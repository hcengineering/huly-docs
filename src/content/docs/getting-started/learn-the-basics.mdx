In many ways, Huly draws inspiration from existing project management tools. There are some tools out there that _just work_, and we've built our own unique versions of these familiar tools into an all-in-one platform where users will immediately feel at home.

However, part of our work at Huly is imagining a better solution for process management that diverges from the beaten path and opens up possibilities for new ways of working. Setting up a task tracker or creating a knowledge base is simple in Huly, but to truly leverage all the platform has to offer, it's important to understand the framework of how the platform works, what configurations are available, and how to navigate the interface.

### How data is organized in your workspace

##### Workspaces

At the highest level is the Huly **workspace**. You can create as many workspaces as you like under the same account, and each workspace is a completely separate entity.

> **Note**: In the near future, we will be adding capabilities for interconnectivity _between_ workspaces, allowing you to manage shared tasks, resources and communication with workspaces operated by different individuals or teams.

##### Spaces

Within your workspace are **spaces**. The name for these spaces depends on the module; for example, spaces in the Tracker are called `projects`, spaces in documents are called `teamspaces`, and spaces in the file drive are called `drives`.

A space determines the settings for all of the objects within that space. Every space has a [space type](/advanced-settings/space-types) that defines the properties, roles, and other configurations for that space. Spaces have owners, members, and privacy settings.

##### Objects

**Objects** are the individual items within a space. For example, in the Tracker, a project contains objects like issues, sub-issues, milestones, and templates. In documents, a teamspace simply contains document objects.

### Navigating the platform

##### Sidebar navigation

All of the available modules are present in the left sidebar. You should see the following modules:

- Inbox
- Planner
- Office
- Contacts
- Chat
- Recruiting
- Human resources
- Tracker
- Documents
- Team
- Drive

> **Note**: You can toggle which of these modules are visible in the sidebar by clicking the settings toggle in the bottom left corner.

##### Context sidebar

Each module has a left sidebar displays additional options and navigation within that module. If the sidebar is not visible, open it by clicking the hamburger icon below your workspace icon in the top left corner.

##### Workbench tabs

By default, the page you are currently viewing will appear as a tab at the top of your workspace. Open a new tab by clicking the `+` button to the right of the current tab. New tabs will automatically open to the inbox, but you can navigate anywhere without losing your place in your other open tabs.

##### Right sidebar tabs

On the right side of your workspace, you'll see icons for your planner and office. Click these to open them in the right sidebar.

Chat conversations can also be pinned to the right sidebar for easy access as you navigat the platform. Live virtual office calls will also be available in the right sidebar during the call.
