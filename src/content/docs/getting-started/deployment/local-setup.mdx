### Prerequisites

Before setting up Huly Platform locally, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- Node.js 20 or later
- npm 9.6.5 or later
- pnpm 7.30.5 or later
- Docker Desktop (for macOS) or Docker Engine (for Linux)
- MongoDB

### System Requirements

> Note: These requirements ensure optimal performance for local development.

- At least 8GB RAM
- 20GB free disk space
- Modern multi-core processor
- Internet connection for package downloads

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the Repository
```bash
gh repo clone hcengineering/platform
cd platform
```

2. Run the Automated Setup Script
```bash
./scripts/deployment/deploy.sh all my_workspace
```

The script will:
- Clean your system of any conflicting installations
- Check and install required dependencies
- Prepare your development branch
- Create your workspace

### Configuration

After installation, configure your development environment:

1. Copy the default configuration:
```bash
cp config/default.conf config/local.conf
```

2. Edit `local.conf` to match your environment settings

### Verify Installation

Run the following checks to ensure everything is set up correctly:

1. Check Node.js version:
```bash
node --version  # Should be 20.x or later
```

2. Verify pnpm installation:
```bash
pnpm --version  # Should be 7.30.5 or later
```

3. Confirm Docker is running:
```bash
docker ps  # Should show running containers
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during setup:

1. Check the logs in `~/.huly/logs/`
2. Ensure all prerequisites are installed
3. Verify Docker is running properly
4. Check MongoDB connection

> Tip: Use `deploy.sh check` to verify your system meets all requirements.

### Development Commands

Common development commands:

```bash
# Full deployment
./deploy.sh all my_workspace

# Individual steps
./deploy.sh clean          # Run system cleanup
./deploy.sh check         # Check dependencies
./deploy.sh prepare       # Prepare branch
./deploy.sh workspace my_workspace  # Create workspace
```

### Getting Help

If you need assistance:
