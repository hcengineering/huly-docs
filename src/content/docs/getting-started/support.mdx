Our goal is to create documentation that covers all features, concepts and capabilities of the platform. However, Huly Docs is still in development, and some features may not be covered. For further guidance, check out some of our other helpful resources below.

## Join us on Slack!

For community support and questions, the best place to reach out is through our <a href="https://huly.link/slack" target="_blank">Slack</a> community. We have a vibrant and growing community of over 600 members who are excited about our products and and eager to share tips and feedback. Our team is also very active in the community and we do our best to respond to as many questions as we can!

Our Slack community is also an excellent place to share your own feature ideas. We'd love to know what kinds of tools would help improve your experience - your feedback is incredibly valuable and helps shape the future of the platform!

## Get in touch on social media

</div>

Feature previews and exciting changes are often shared first on our social media channels before they're even released! This is also a great platform to share your experience with Huly and get inspiration from other Huly users. Our team is active on X and LinkedIn and we respond regularly to questions and feedback.

## YouTube

We're always adding to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/@huly_io" target="_blank">Huly</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TraceX" target="_blank">TraceX</a> YouTube channels to include more feature demos and guided tutorials. This is a great place to start when looking for a quick overview of a key feature of the platform.

If you have an idea for a tutorial that hasn't been created yet, let us know and we'll add it to the list!
