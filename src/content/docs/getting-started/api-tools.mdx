## Huly API 

Huly has a basic API to get you started with your own integrations and extensions. Check out the [API documentation](https://github.com/hcengineering/huly-examples/tree/main/platform-api#readme) for setup steps and usage examples.

## Huly Import Tool

We offer an import tool to help you import data directly into your Huly workspace.

Using our Unified Import Format, you can migrate your data into Huly by converting it to an intermediate, human-readable structure. Check out the [Huly Import Tool documentation](https://github.com/hcengineering/platform/tree/develop/dev/import-tool#readme) for setup steps and examples.

We also support imports from [Notion](https://github.com/hcengineering/platform/blob/develop/dev/import-tool/docs/notion/README.md) and [ClickUp](https://github.com/hcengineering/platform/blob/develop/dev/import-tool/docs/clickup/README.md).
